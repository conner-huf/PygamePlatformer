# PygamePlatformer

Hi there! I made this platforming game in PyGame, following a tutorial by DaFluffYPotato on YouTube. 

Controls: /br
  - W = jump
  - A = move left
  - D = move right
  - X = dash / attack

Objective:
  - Dash through each enemy in the level to move on to the next level. There are 3 pre made levels to play through.

This is my first foray into making a game - and therefore is very closely following a tutorial - so all credit to DaFluffyPotato on YouTube.
Below are some screenshots of the game.

There is also a level editor available for you to make your own level. You can save a level and play through it in the main python file (game.py). There is currently no user interface available, so this has to be done through editing the editor.py file. You can enter the name of the json file you want to edit in the "load_map" function in editor.py and you should be able to edit a level. Alternatively, you can make a new json file and access it in the same way to make an entirely new level.

The game has music, sound effects, hit effects, projectiles, and basic physics.
I'm hoping to build on this to make something of my own at some point, and hopefully expand!
Thanks for reading :)
